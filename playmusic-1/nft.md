**Using Future NFT's**

* NFT's will have several functions and several use cases in our platform! As the NFTs are tradable, besides being affordable, you will be able to trade our marketplace without restriction, you will have a plan that will make it possible to include other projects in the markets! NFTs will probably be very appreciable for customers, as they are considerably high. Besides being a great instrument to stabilize the price of PLAY, as NFTs have a decay period. The Playmusic NFT feature is still holding many surprises in store for users! Soon a document will be released in our system that will teach you how to use NFTs and the NFT Pool. Stay tuned!
* We live in an increasingly globalized world that impacts the demands of its population exponentially. In a global context we live interacting with people from everywhere and each with its own particularities, and we know that the universal language between people is music, and the link that unites them is the artistic expressions in its various manifestations ... There are channels and several other means for artists to show their talent to the world, PLAYMUSIC wants to give this artist the opportunity to tokenize his art, and also to the established artist to transform his success into a unique and disruptive work.
