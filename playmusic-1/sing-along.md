# ðŸŽ¼ Sing Along



* Music has been the most propitious way to propagate human inspiration, that's why we are committed to develop a self-sustaining and liberated ecosystem for music creators. Therewith, we developed "Sing With Me", a program to find and fund unrecognized and extraordinary inspirations from all around the world... So, investors who allocate their music can eventually go to a physical recording studio and realize their dream... We are more than an ambitious project, which enables investors to earn returns by listening... we grant them the possibility to become a music superstar!
