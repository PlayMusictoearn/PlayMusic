# ðŸŽ¼ Sing Along

Music has been the most propitious way to propagate human inspiration, so we are committed to developing a self-sustaining and liberated ecosystem for music creators. With this, we developed "Sing With Me", a program to find and fund unrecognized and extraordinary inspirations from around the world... With this, investors who allocate their music can eventually go to a physical recording studio and realize their dream... We are more than an ambitious project, which enables investors to earn returns by listening... we grant them the possibility to become a music superstar !
