# ðŸŽ¼ Web3

* Everything starts in the mid 90's, when the popularity of browsers began, starting the so-called Web1, a decade later, the mega platforms, such as Google and Facebook, starting the Web2, both scenarios have concentration of power, leaked information and data available in large companies, with this there were several questions about how far we were private ... without monitoring of large economies.
* And with questionings and invasions becoming clearer and clearer, concepts began to appear that would take these powers away from the big economies, the well-known WEB3, where it is based on the blockchain, whose communication network is decentralized and has no owner. The blockchain is a kind of shared and immutable system that facilitates the process of registering transactions and tracking assets on a network. The term means "blockchain," which is the model used to store information in a system. It can be used for everything from cross-border payments between different countries to medical and leisure records.&#x20;
* The Decentraland metaverse, for example, was created by a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) in Ethereum. All of these transactions are classified as Web3, as they are located on the blockchain.
* We can classify web3 in relation to its ancestors, as:

<!---->

* [x] Faster, more secure and open ;
* [x] A new architecture, where it cannot be manipulated ;
* [x] Decentralized.
