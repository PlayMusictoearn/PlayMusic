# ðŸ›¡ Anti-Dump Security

Amidst the adversities found in the market and with the purpose of bringing security to our investors, PlayMusic developed an antidumping system, where we will use the same BSC protocol for transaction and blockchain architecture. With this we will only have changes in the handshake. We initially set up a blockchain network, with 15 blocks where there will be no transactions, because they are empty blocks and allow us to park. With this, all system registrations will be via blockchain, which generates more reliability, security and transparency to our investors.

Through our project being based on blockchain, we can guarantee our investors a very effective security, because it is a mathematical algorithm with a high level of complexity, which acts as a firewall for possible attacks, with this all encrypted information is stored in the hash, impossible to be changed or reversed, the hash stores information hidden in its data nature.
