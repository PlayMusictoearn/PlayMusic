# ðŸ›¡ Anti-Dump Security

Amidst the adversities found in the market and with the purpose of bringing security to our investors, PlayMusic developed an antidumping system, where we will use the same BSC protocol for transaction and blockchain architecture. With this we will only have changes in the handshake. We initially set up a blockchain network, with 15 blocks where there will be no transactions, because they are empty blocks and allow us to park. With this, all system registrations will be via blockchain, which generates more reliability, security and transparency to our investors.
