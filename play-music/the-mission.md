# ðŸŽ¶ The mission

Music is a human inspiration, which in its moments of hurt, sadness, euphoria, joy and several others, put into lyrics all the whirlwind of feelings involved. For music there are no barriers, whether you are a street artist, a metal drummer, an underground musician impacted by metal and folk music, from every superstar celebrity to a humble artist, music is the first and last energy that feeds your soul. With this we seek to make real the paradox of fugacity to eternity. Our mission is to break through the antinomy and pioneer the unorthodox path to musical innovation.
